Contribute to open-source or internal frameworks for secure code review, dependency risk detection, and compliance automation. Partner with developers to design security libraries and SDKs that make “secure by default” easy to adopt. 3. Threat Modeling & Design Reviews Drive security architecture reviews and model threats for new features. Translate findings into engineering solutions and automation guardrails. Contribute reusable threat modeling templates or scripts that scale across teams. 4. Application Security Testing Perform and automate web, API, and mobile app security assessments. Develop scripts to correlate findings across scanners, triage false positives, and prioritize remediation. Build one-click validation tools or fuzzers that developers can run locally. 5. Developer Empowerment & Culture Contribute to internal security documentation, workshops, and awareness programs. Champion developer-first security automation - faster fixes, fewer blockers. Continuously identify opportunities to eliminate manual effort via code. What You Will Need Education: B.Tech/M.Tech in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or equivalent technical field.
